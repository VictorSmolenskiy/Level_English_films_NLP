397

it's really hard for her.

could fix that, it'd be Santa.

that this was the single
worst day of the year.

And now here it was,
that day once again

455
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,930
when he felt all those feelings
he felt way back when.

456
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:08,097
When he'd watch Whos young

They'd feast on Who-pudding,
and rare Who roast beast.

Which is something the Grinch
could not stand in the least.

And then they'd do something
he liked least of all.

Cindy-Lou, could you make
a little room for this, please?

1257
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,114
No, don't worry.
I've got it.

Bricklebaum, good to see you.

Come on, Grinchy, give me a hug.
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

1263

It don't count if
you don't hug back, buddy.

Okay, come take your seats,
everyone. Dinner's ready.

Do you mind
if I say something first?

1276
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,758
Not at all.

1277
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:44,965
Um, well, everybody,
I just want to say,

1278
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:48,134
I've spent my entire life

1279
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:51,722
hating Christmas
and everything about it.

1280
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:56,772
But now I see that
it wasn't Christmas I hated,

1281
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,486
it was being alone.

1282
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,904
But I'm not alone anymore.

1283
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:11,036
And I have all of you
to thank for it.

1284
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,373

1285
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,414
this little girl right here.

Ma'am,

1287
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:22,794
your daughter's kindness
changed my life.
