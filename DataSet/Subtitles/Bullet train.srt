The Japanese underworld
used to be ruled by a man named Minegishi.

364
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,031
<i>Now, Minegishi was one brutal bastard.</i>

365

<i>Bit by bit. Kill by kill.</i>

375
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,688
<i>And very, very fucking quickly became
one of Minegishi's closest advisors.</i>

376
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,027
<i>And those loyal to him said:</i>

377
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,201
<i>"Hold your horses.
This geezer ain't the full ticket.</i>

378

<i>"A White Death."</i>

382
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,416

383
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,461

worthy of the White Death.</i>

390
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,667
So, let me put this bluntly.

391
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,593

- Okay, if he's such a badass,

397
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,188
how come he hired two random operators
instead of getting his son back himself?

398
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,444
If you actually read the briefings
you'd know that he had a wife.

399
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,649
What, he had a wife?

400
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,452
She was the most important

"train sticker by the handle"?

1031

1033

But you...

1034
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,293
You said "briefcase."

1035
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,704

No, I understand. I get it.

1051
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,633

'cause I'm thinking,

you point at the one who is.

He said that he was going to kill you

He also said that there's someone
waiting for us at Kyoto Station.
