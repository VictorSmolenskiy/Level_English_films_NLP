As you approached hyper speed,

350

your time slowed relative to our own.

351

you aged only minutes,

DERIC: Now, should you prefer
a more scenic route,

2073
01:43:39,428 --> 01:43:42,347
you'll want to head south
past the Bromide Swamps,

2074
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:45,142
a breathtaking sight, or so I am told.

2075
01:43:45,225 --> 01:43:48,687
But, if you're in a hurry,
this would be your most direct route.

Hello?
